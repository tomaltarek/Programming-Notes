# Signal 

Unlike exception signal can raise from outside a program, may be from operating system or some user action who knows. 

Common example of a signal is, when we run a program in console, when we press Ctl+C, the program termintates. Therefore Ctl+C is a signal interruption. 

In C, to deal with signal interruption, it has header <signal.h>
