When you start a project from the scratch or clone/download it from the git hub, your first job is to make the project directory
a git directory. At the very first stage you might not want to push it to github, but it is always a good idea to make practice git
locally so that your hard work cannot be lost. Suppose you start a project and it is running well, then to add some functionality,
you work on that project for hours and at some point you realize the project is not working it is a complete mess, in that case you
have to delete everything and start from the scratch, all your hard work is gone. Therefore you need to use version controlling professionally.
At the beginning stage when your project is working fine, make a branch from the master branch. Then work on this new branch, do not practice git commit all the time,
better just work on it so that with git you can go back to original or adjust the changes with git gui you can take decision line by line which to stay which to go away. 
When you think a milestone is done, at that point you do a git commit. And after you are done all the new features/functionality you meant to, 
at that point merge your new branch to master and delete the new branch.
